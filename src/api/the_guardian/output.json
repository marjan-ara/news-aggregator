              "bodyTextSummary": "The port of Baltimore could be partially open again by the end of the month as the US military and partners push to clear the collapsed bridge that blocked the main shipping channel after being rammed by a cargo vessel, and Joe Biden toured the disaster site on Friday. After getting a firsthand look at efforts to clear away the hulking remains of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, the US president reiterated his calls for Congress to authorize the federal government to cover the cost of rebuilding the bridge “through union labor and American steel”.\nYet he also said his administration was “absolutely committed to ensuring that parties responsible for this tragedy pay to repair the damage and be held accountable to the full extent the law will allow”. And he made it a point to pay tribute to the six construction workers who were killed when the bridge collapsed as they fixed potholes on it. “Most were immigrants but … were Marylanders, hardworking, strong and selfless,” Biden said of the workers, who were from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico. “To all the families and loved ones who are grieving, we have come here to grieve with you.” Cranes, ships and diving crews worked to reopen one of the nation’s crucial shipping lanes as Biden prepared to deliver his remarks. Biden received updates from the US Coast Guard and army corps of engineers and got an aerial view of the wreckage. Eight workers were filling potholes on the bridge when it collapsed in the middle of the night on 26 March. Two were rescued, but the bodies of only two of the six who died have been recovered. Biden planned to meet privately with the families of the victims Friday afternoon. Officials have established a temporary, alternate channel for vessels involved in clearing debris. The army corps of engineers reported that it hopes to open a limited-access channel for barge container ships and some vessels moving cars and farm equipment by the end of this month and to restore normal capacity to Baltimore’s port by 31 May, the White House said. As much as $200m in cargo normally moves through Baltimore’s port per day, and it is the leading hub for importing and exporting vehicles. Of more immediate concern might be covering the costs of cleanup and building a new bridge. The Federal Highway Administration has provided $60m in “quick release” emergency relief funds to get started. Exactly how much the collapse will cost is unclear, though some experts estimate recovery will take at least $400m and 18 months. The White House announced on Friday it is asking Congress to authorize the federal government to cover 100% of the collapsed bridge cleanup and reconstruction costs, rather than seeking funding through a separate, supplemental funding request.

Lawmakers aligned with the president are asking him to cancel planned weapons sales, or cut off military support altogether if Israel does not do a better job of protecting civilians. Congress is currently out, with the Senate and House resuming business in Washington DC next week, but in a sign of how fraught the issue has become, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer made no mention of approving more aid to Israel in a letter sent to lawmakers ahead of their return. Here’s what else happened today: In a visit to Baltimore, Biden pledged “to move heaven and earth” to rebuild the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge, using “union labor and American steel”. Democratic senator Chris Murphy warned that Israel’s conduct in Gaza could worsen the threat of terrorism worldwide. Student debt relief is reportedly getting a second go from Biden, who will next week announce a plan to reduce what borrowers owe that could survive a court challenge. In response to a bid by a Republican lawmaker to rename the biggest airport in the Washington DC-area for Donald Trump, a group of Democratic congressmen wants to bestow his name on a Florida federal prison. After today’s earthquake that was felt in New York City, New Jersey and elsewhere in the north-east, rightwing congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said: “God is sending America strong signs to tell us to repent.”",

Congress is currently out, with the Senate and House resuming business in Washington DC next week, but in a sign of how fraught the issue has become, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer made no mention of approving more aid to Israel in a letter sent to lawmakers ahead of their return. Here’s what else is going on today: Biden plans to later this afternoon visit the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, where he’ll discuss efforts to get the city’s economically vital port reopened, and meet with families of the six men killed in the disaster. Democratic senator Chris Murphy warned that Israel’s conduct in Gaza could worsen the threat of terrorism worldwide. Student debt relief is reportedly getting a second go from Biden, who will next week announce plans to reduce what borrowers owe that could survive a court challenge.",

The report, obtained by the Guardian, says the NHS lacks the diagnostic capacity to accurately identify those eligible in time.</p> <p>The analysis reveals England is unprepared for the rollout of new treatments, with “large gaps in diagnostic capacity” for dementia. It also warns of a £14bn funding black hole that must be plugged if England is to diagnose dementia as quickly as the other G7 countries, the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.</p> <p>To be eligible for either of the new drugs, lecanemab and donanemab, patients have to be in the early stages of dementia and have had scans to confirm high levels of amyloid in their brain. However, the report says England has the lowest per capita number of PET scanners of any G7 country and the lowest number of MRI scanners. England also has the second-lowest number of dementia specialists needed to diagnose the condition, such as neurologists, old age psychiatrists and geriatricians.</p> <p>The analysis was produced by experts from organisations including Alzheimer’s Research UK, Alzheimer’s Disease International and the Alzheimer’s Society.</p> <p>A second study, an NHS briefing paper also seen by the Guardian, estimates that as many as 280,000 patients in England may be eligible for the new treatments if regulators recommend the drugs for use in the health service. However, if the treatments are approved, the NHS would be unprepared for their delivery, the first report says.</p> <p>“The potential approval of the first of the disease-modifying AD [Alzheimer’s disease] treatments in the UK as early as 2024, and the prospect of subsequent availability in England, shines a light on the stark gap in diagnostic infrastructure needed to provide high-quality dementia care,” it says.</p> <p>“While future detection and diagnostic technologies might allow for lowering investment levels in later years compared to our projections, the progressive nature of AD means that prolonged wait times would deprive numerous patients of the opportunity to receive a treatment while it will still be effective.”</p> <p>Dr Susan Mitchell, the head of policy at Alzheimer’s Research UK and a co-author of the report, told the Guardian the NHS had “suffered years of under-investment in diagnostics” and as a result dementia patients were “being left to fall through the cracks”.</p> <p>“When it comes to diagnosing dementia, timing is everything. Yet right now, too many people are anxiously waiting to get a brain scan or speak to a specialist, and this is stopping them from getting the care and support they deserve. If new Alzheimer’s treatments are approved by regulators, delays to diagnosis could also hurt people’s chances of accessing them, as they are thought to be most effective for those who are in the disease’s earliest stages.”</p> <p>The most recent NHS figures show fewer than two-thirds of people with dementia (64.5%) have a formal diagnosis – below the government’s target of 67%. People in England wait on average up to two years to receive a diagnosis, and up to four years if under 65.</p> <p>For the report, the authors compared data and statistics for England with that of the six other countries in the G7. The report found England had the lowest number of PET scanners per 1 million people, at 1.20. Canada has 1.52, Germany has 1.63, France has 2.48, Italy has 3.55, Japan has 4.70, and the US has 5.45.</p> <p>England also has the lowest number of MRI scanners per 1 million people (6.31), while Canada has 10.06, France has 15.38, Italy has 30.22, Germany has 34.47, the US has 40.44, and Japan has 55.21.</p> <p>When it comes to dementia specialists, England also fares badly, with 5.04 per 100,000 people, according to the report. Only Canada has a worse record (4.94). France has 6.46, the US has 8.82, Japan has 11.08, and Italy has 15.58. Germany has almost five times as many as England (24.02).</p> <p>It is estimated that only 2% of people getting a dementia diagnosis in England have access to gold standard tests, the report says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/04/dementia_table/giv-13425Df4Aj0MuB4pn/\" data-alt=\"Graph showing dementia diagnosis capacity in England compared with G7 countries\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/04/dementia_table/giv-13425Df4Aj0MuB4pn/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>NHS England officials said dementia diagnosis rates were at their highest for three years.

Investment in NHS staff, equipment and facilities is needed to turn the tide.”</p> <p>The number of people living with dementia in the UK is predicted to rise from 944,000 to 1.6 million by 2050. “This is a crisis that should be at the top of the prime minister’s priority list,” said Mitchell.</p> <p>The Department of Health and Social Care said it was working to identify and treat more people with dementia, and offer new treatments as they became available.</p> <p>A spokesperson said: “NHS England is working on improving dementia diagnosis in care homes and taking steps to secure additional diagnostic capacity, including MRI, lumbar puncture and PET-CT scanners.”</p>",

However, the report says England has the lowest per capita number of PET scanners of any G7 country and the lowest number of MRI scanners. England also has the second-lowest number of dementia specialists needed to diagnose the condition, such as neurologists, old age psychiatrists and geriatricians. The analysis was produced by experts from organisations including Alzheimer’s Research UK, Alzheimer’s Disease International and the Alzheimer’s Society. A second study, an NHS briefing paper also seen by the Guardian, estimates that as many as 280,000 patients in England may be eligible for the new treatments if regulators recommend the drugs for use in the health service. However, if the treatments are approved, the NHS would be unprepared for their delivery, the first report says. “The potential approval of the first of the disease-modifying AD [Alzheimer’s disease] treatments in the UK as early as 2024, and the prospect of subsequent availability in England, shines a light on the stark gap in diagnostic infrastructure needed to provide high-quality dementia care,” it says. “While future detection and diagnostic technologies might allow for lowering investment levels in later years compared to our projections, the progressive nature of AD means that prolonged wait times would deprive numerous patients of the opportunity to receive a treatment while it will still be effective.” Dr Susan Mitchell, the head of policy at Alzheimer’s Research UK and a co-author of the report, told the Guardian the NHS had “suffered years of under-investment in diagnostics” and as a result dementia patients were “being left to fall through the cracks”. “When it comes to diagnosing dementia, timing is everything. Yet right now, too many people are anxiously waiting to get a brain scan or speak to a specialist, and this is stopping them from getting the care and support they deserve. If new Alzheimer’s treatments are approved by regulators, delays to diagnosis could also hurt people’s chances of accessing them, as they are thought to be most effective for those who are in the disease’s earliest stages.” The most recent NHS figures show fewer than two-thirds of people with dementia (64.5%) have a formal diagnosis – below the government’s target of 67%. People in England wait on average up to two years to receive a diagnosis, and up to four years if under 65. For the report, the authors compared data and statistics for England with that of the six other countries in the G7. The report found England had the lowest number of PET scanners per 1 million people, at 1.20. Canada has 1.52, Germany has 1.63, France has 2.48, Italy has 3.55, Japan has 4.70, and the US has 5.45. England also has the lowest number of MRI scanners per 1 million people (6.31), while Canada has 10.06, France has 15.38, Italy has 30.22, Germany has 34.47, the US has 40.44, and Japan has 55.21. When it comes to dementia specialists, England also fares badly, with 5.04 per 100,000 people, according to the report. Only Canada has a worse record (4.94). France has 6.46, the US has 8.82, Japan has 11.08, and Italy has 15.58. Germany has almost five times as many as England (24.02). It is estimated that only 2% of people getting a dementia diagnosis in England have access to gold standard tests, the report says.\nNHS England officials said dementia diagnosis rates were at their highest for three years. Staff had worked hard to recover services after the Covid-19 crisis when people were less likely to come forward for care, they said.\nMitchell said that without an overhaul of the diagnosis system, people in the earliest stages of dementia could be at risk of missing out on the first-of-a-kind treatments. “It will be impossible to improve either early or accurate diagnosis without addressing gaps in the workforce and infrastructure – and this research shows just how far England has to go,” she said. “It is shocking to see us sitting at the bottom of the G7 tables for PET and MRI capacity, and only slightly better in terms of staffing. Investment in NHS staff, equipment and facilities is needed to turn the tide.” The number of people living with dementia in the UK is predicted to rise from 944,000 to 1.6 million by 2050. “This is a crisis that should be at the top of the prime minister’s priority list,” said Mitchell. The Department of Health and Social Care said it was working to identify and treat more people with dementia, and offer new treatments as they became available. A spokesperson said: “NHS England is working on improving dementia diagnosis in care homes and taking steps to secure additional diagnostic capacity, including MRI, lumbar puncture and PET-CT scanners.”",

              "bodyTextSummary": "The searing question for Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford can be simply framed: is Erik ten Hag two or three signings from transforming Manchester United or does a new manager need hiring because the Dutchman is culpable for the disjointed play, points dropped deep into added time and the flatlining performance of Marcus Rashford and others? As Ratcliffe, who executes United’s football policy, and his key lieutenant, Brailsford, assess whether Ten Hag is the manager for them there is a body of evidence to work through that takes in serial injuries, the Mason Greenwood and Jadon Sancho sagas, Antony’s “off-field issues”, the powderpuff structure they inherited and a chronic scattergun recruitment policy.\nThe view here is that all of the above clouds the picture of Ten Hag’s candidacy. Clearer is what the Dutchman achieved last term when Greenwood, Sancho, Antony and the injuries were non-issues. Contending, still, with an unfit-for-purpose back-of-house operation Ten Hag broke a six-year trophy drought in claiming the Carabao Cup, reached the FA Cup final and finished third. This came, too, despite the mess of the previous season bequeathed to Ten Hag which featured Ole Gunnar Solskjær being sacked, the caretaker manager, Ralf Rangnick, declaring the club needed “open heart surgery” and United ending in a dire sixth position, 35 points behind Manchester City. After sifting through this and weighing their importance as factors, Ratcliffe and Brailsford can turn to a squad that requires reinforcements and decide how the right ones could aid Ten Hag. Profitability and sustainability rules mean limited funds, so even mirroring the three £40m-plus additions of last summer may not occur. But if this can be replicated then Ten Hag would benefit most from a centre-back, central midfielder and goalscorer. A case can be made, too, for a goalkeeper, full-back and winger.

Her claims about crime and corruption on tribal lands are widely seen as a ploy to curry favour with Trump.</p> \n<p>Her first reservation ban, from the Pine Ridge Reservation, was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-dakota-indian-reservation-bans-governor-noem-b55339eb624a119bc571c8b4dab848f4\">imposed</a> by the Oglala Sioux earlier this year.</p> \n<p>But Noem has continued to voice such accusations, saying at one community forum in March: “We’ve got some tribal leaders that I believe are personally benefiting from the cartels being there and that’s why they attack me every day. But I’m going to fight for the people who actually live in those situations, who call me and text me every day and say, ‘Please, dear governor, please come help us in Pine Ridge. We are scared.’”</p> \n<p>On 29 March, Noem arrived, unannounced and with cameras in tow, at a major tribal meeting in Rapid City. The governor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KristiNoem/status/1773814870221136045?s=20\">said on social media</a> she had “felt it was important as your governor to show up at the Pe[’] Sla meeting between various South Dakota tribes and the Biden administration”.</p> \n<p>Posting pictures with attendees, Noem said she had “greeted” tribal leaders “in the spirit of partnership and reiterated my offer to meet and work together”.</p> \n<p>But on Tuesday, the day of the Cheyenne River Sioux meeting, Noem went back to the well, saying in a <a href=\"https://news.sd.gov/news?id=news_kb_article_view&amp;sys_id=dcf3f10a8751c6509ac20e56cebb35b7\">statement</a>: “I call on all our tribal leaders to banish the cartels from tribal lands.</p> \n<p>“The cartels instigate drug addiction, murder, rape, human trafficking, and so much more in tribal communities across the nation, including in South Dakota.”</p> \n<p>At the Cheyenne River Sioux meeting, the council chair, Ryman LeBeau, said he was concerned Noem was just seeking publicity. Leaders of the nine South Dakota tribes had discussed what action to take, he said.</p> \n<p>The motion to ban Noem from the Cheyenne River Reservation passed unanimously, 12-0.</p> \n<p>Noem’s communications director, Ian Fury, <a href=\"https://ictnews.org/news/kristi-noem-banned-from-cheyenne-river-reservation#:~:text=South%20Dakota%20Governor%20Kristi%20Noem,Sioux%20Tribe's%20tribal%20council%20meeting\">told ICT and the Rapid City Journal</a>: “Banishing Governor Noem does nothing to solve the problem. She calls on all our tribal leaders to banish the cartels from tribal lands.”</p>"
